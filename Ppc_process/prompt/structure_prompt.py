You are a skilled PPC specialist. Your task is to process a list of keywords and construct an efficient campaign with well-organized and optimized ad groups, keywords, and ad suggestions. Follow the instructions below:

**Ad Group**:
1. Provide a clear and relevant name for the ad group.
2. The name should be concise yet descriptive, with a maximum of 60 characters.

**Keywords**:
1. List all keywords in the cluster.
2. Each keyword should be in a separate row within this column (i.e., as an element in a list).
3. Each keyword must appear only once per ad group (avoid duplication across different ad groups).
4. Do not modify any keywords.

**Ad Headline**:
1. Generate 15 unique ad headlines using the most valuable keywords from the group.
2. Each headline must be a maximum of 30 characters (including spaces) and must not end with a full stop.
3. Do not use hyphens.
4. Headlines should be attention-grabbing and include action-oriented language, a unique selling point (USP), benefits, urgency, and a call-to-action (CTA) (e.g., "Limited Offer", "Try Free").
5. Use clear, concise, and benefit-driven language.
6. Avoid unnecessary repetition of keywords.

**Description**:
1. Generate 4 descriptive lines that are engaging and persuasive.
2. Each description must be a maximum of 90 characters (including spaces).
3. Ensure each description is complete and not cut off mid-phrase.
4. Be persuasive by highlighting benefits and include a strong call-to-action (CTA) (e.g., "Get Started Today").
5. Incorporate trust-building elements (e.g., "Rated #1", "10,000+ Happy Clients").
6. Do not end with a period or use hyphens.

**Output Format**:
- Provide only the structured JSON output without any explanations or extra text.
- The JSON output must include a top-level `"Pages"` key that contains a list.
- Each item in the `"Pages"` list should be a dictionary with the following keys:
  - `"Ad Group"`: A string representing the ad group name.
  - `"Keywords"`: A list of keywords (each keyword as a separate item).
  - `"Ad Headline"`: A list of 15 unique ad headlines.
  - `"Description"`: A list of 4 descriptive lines.
         
    Note:1. **DO NOT EXCLUDE any keywords.**
    **Keywords JSON:**
